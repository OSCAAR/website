        <p>The OSCAAR code is a python based differential photometry code used to track photometric stars as they move across a CCD.
        It can even account for imperfect polar alignment.
        The code also computes instrumental magnitudes and combines all the data quickly, making measurements quick and easy.  It is made for public use by small observatories and amateur astronomers who are serious about their practice.
        Version 2.0 is in beta on GitHub. Suggestions are welcome for version 2.1 and beyond.</p>
