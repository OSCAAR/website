        <h1><strong>7'' Telescope</strong></h1>
        <br/>
        <p style="color:white;">The 7'' telescope at the University of Maryland Observatory is a 7'' Astro-Physics Refractor.
        It allows for clear views of planets and star clusters and is used often by visitors during open houses.
        It was donated to the observatory by Marty Cohen of Company 7 to help get clear views of stellar objects even with the poor visibility in the College Park area.</p>

        <h1 ><strong>6'' Telescope</strong></h1>
        <br/>
        <p style="color:white;">The 6'' telescope is a 152 mm Astro Physics f/9 refracting telescope on an AP900 equatorial mount.
        The telescope does not actually belong to the university, it belongs to Elizabeth M. Warner, one of hte astrology professors.
        Elizabeth brought in this telescope to be used to test new equipment in the observatory to see if it was worth purchasing for the 7'' telescope.
        The observations on exoplanets that Brett Morris made on the 6'' telescope helped contribute to convincing the University to fund upgrading the 7'' telescope.</p>
